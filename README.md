> A unified API gateway for multiple LLM providers.

This project intends to build an "Artificial Intelligence API" (AIA), which will serve as an API gateway to multiple LLM providers. The goal is to make an easy to integrate unified API, which could easily be self-hosted on low-end hardware.

## Features
- Login support (Google OAuth2) for Applications intended to serve multiple users.
- API Key verification for users that should be allowed to poll the API directly, no Login required.
- Chat completion through LLM providers.
- Local Ollama configurations may be added.
- Users may add their own API keys for interaction with third party LLM Providers.
- Integration with Qdrant.
- Server side session management for frontend apps.
- MCP support.
- User document upload (Files, Skills, Memories).
- Web Search through FireCrawl.

## Tech Stack
- FastAPI
- LangChain
- LangFuse
- Docker
- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- GCP (OAuth2)
- Kubernetes
- Qdrant

## Supported LLM Providers
- Current supported Providers are tested and verified with personally obtained API keys.

### Current
- Ollama (if self-hosted)
- Anthropic
- Melious
- OpenAI
- Z.ai
- Mistral

## Setup
- Please check the 'SETUP.md' file to get started.

## API Endpoints
> All Endpoints are prefixed with '/api/v1'.

### Agent Invocation
POST /agent
POST /agent/stream

### Auth
GET /auth/google/login
GET /auth/google/callback
GET /auth/me

### Documents
GET /documents/user/{scope}
DELETE /documents/user/{document_id}

### Skills
POST, GET, PATCH /skill

### Vector Store / Embedding
POST /vector_embedding/test
POST /vector_store/{scope}/add
POST /vector_store/{scope}/search

### Providers
GET /providers/models
GET /providers/models/sampling
GET /providers/configuration

### Root & Status
GET /root
GET /status

### Tools
GET /tools/mcp

### Translations
POST /translation/translategemma
GET /translation/translategemma

### Settings
POST /settings/user/keys

## Roadmap

### Short Term
- Add HMAC hashing and verification for each path.
- Build a function to locate which server is currently supporting translategemma: Check internal
servers first, follow by external ones. Return internal as this one is free of charge.

### Long Term
- Add support for more Login providers.
- Add agent building functionalities.
- Log conversation ids and history in a conversation table.
- Enable possibility to share agents with other users.

## Contributing
PRs welcome!

## Documentation
Full interactive API documentation is available at `/docs` (Swagger UI)
or `/redoc` (ReDoc) when the server is running.
